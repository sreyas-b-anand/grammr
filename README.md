## API Integration

To utilize the Gemini API, you'll need to follow these steps to set up your API key:

1. **Obtain Your API Key**
   - Sign up at [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/api) to obtain your API key.

2. **Set Up Your API Key**
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project directory if you haven't already.
   - Add your API key to the `.env.local` file:
     ```plaintext
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

3. **Install the Gemini API SDK**
   - If you haven't installed it yet, add the Google AI JavaScript SDK to your project:
     ```bash
     npm install @google/generative-ai
     ```

4. **Import the Library and Configure Your Key**
   - In your application code, import the library and configure it with your API key:
     ```javascript
     import { GenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai';

     const aiClient = new GenerativeAI({
         apiKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY,
     });
     ```

5. **Make Your First Request**
   - Use the `generateContent` method to generate text:
     ```javascript
     const response = await aiClient.generateContent({
         prompt: "Your prompt here",
         // Other parameters as needed
     });
     console.log(response);
     ```

6. **Restart Your Development Server**
   - After setting up your API key and making changes, restart your development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

Make sure to keep your `.env.local` file secure and do not share it publicly.
 - Access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
